1.First run the CNF generator program,chose the number of variables and clauses.This will generate the SAT problem in "generated_problem.cnf".

2.Open one of the SAT algorithms and check the required libraries and install any that you do not have.

3.All Programs by default have the "generated_problem.cnf" file as the computed file.If you wish to compute a different file change the value of the variable
"filename" to the one you wish to compute.

POTENTIAL PROBLEM:
If when trying to run the code you get a "module not found" error even though you installed the required library your source code 
editor may be using the wrong python interpreter.Solutions to this problem vary from editor to editor but a simple solution can be
found on the editors site.
